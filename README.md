# jaro-winkler-JS
An implementation of the _Jaro-Winkler_ distance algorithm in Javascript (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance).

This is a pretty direct translation of the Winkler, McLaughlin, Jaro and Lynch version found here: http://web.archive.org/web/20100227020019/http://www.census.gov/geo/msb/stand/strcmp.c.

I needed a quick solution for a fuzzy string matching problem and didn't find any JS implementations that were easy to grab - hence this. I hope someone else finds this useful.

Note that this was the work of half an hour or so, so there might be mistakes in there (it's worked fine for me so far though). Any comments or pointers are most welcome!
